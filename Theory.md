## Supervised machine learning

**What is supervised machine learning? 😊**

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning in which our algorithms are trained using well-labeled training data, and machines predict the output based on that data. Labeled data indicates that the input data has already been tagged with the appropriate output. Basically, it is the task of learning a function that maps the input set and returns an output. Some of its examples are: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, KNN, etc.


## Linear regression

**what is regression? Which models can you use to solve a regression problems? 😊**

Regression is a part of supervised ML. Regression models investigate the relationship between a dependent (target) and independent variable (s).

- *Linear Regression* establishes a linear relationship between target and predictor (s). It predicts a numeric value and has a shape of a straight line.
- *Polynomial Regression* has a regression equation with the power of independent variable more than 1. It is a curve that fits into the data points.
- *Ridge Regression* helps when predictors are highly correlated (multicollinearity problem). It penalizes the squares of regression coefficients but doesn’t allow the coefficients to reach zeros (uses L2 regularization).
- *Lasso Regression* penalizes the absolute values of regression coefficients and allows some of the coefficients to reach absolute zero (thereby allowing feature selection).


**What is linear regression? When do we use it? 😊**

Linear regression is a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (X) and the single output variable (y).
